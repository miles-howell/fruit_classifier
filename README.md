This repository contains a minimal implementation of a single-layer neural network built from scratch using only NumPy. It is designed as a learning tool to understand the core principles of how neural networks work under the hood.

### Features and Concepts Covered ###
* Single-layer feedforward neural network (no hidden layers)
*Random weight initialization
*Forward propagation using the sigmoid activation function
*Backpropagation using the sigmoid derivative
*Gradient descent for weight optimization
*Binary classification using 2 input features
*Manual training loop over multiple iterations
*No machine learning libraries used (only NumPy)

The model is trained to classify fruit based on weight and color (0-green, 1-yellow) and output a binary classifier (0-lime, 1-lemon)


Requirements
Python 3.x
NumPy
